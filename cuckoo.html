              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Background</h5>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Rice is at the center of every Korean meal. Like any Korean family, we used generations of Cuckoo rice cookers until it was time I bought a new one for myself. I was excited by the aesthetics of the product, the fuzzy logic algorithm that it boasts, and the multiple cooking presets that came with it, including the ability to cook various types of grains, beans, and even bread. My initial excitement to having my own Cuckoo rice cooker soon wore off, however, because I was only used to making rice and nothing else. While I wanted to try other cooking pre-sets, the product came with a small <a href="https://issuu.com/cuckoousa/docs/crp-dhsr0609f_eng" target="_blank">booklet</a> with explanations of many on-device symbols or icons along with few pages of recipes. It was really challenging for me to read through all the instructions to understand what it's like to use cooking presets other than rice. Today, many cooking products offer smarter connected experiences to increase their competitive advantage. This connected experience, afforded by the mobile app, can enable people to engage deeply with the product features by providing various opportunities to explore cooking related contents such as recipes, images, and videos. I wanted to find out what opportunities exist for the Cuckoo rice cooker to provide a connected experience to its customers.
              </p><br>

              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Goal</h5>
              <p style="text-align:left;">The goal of this project is to research and design a connected experience for users of the Cuckoo rice cooker.</p>
              <br>

              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Determining the Value Proposition</h5>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Redefining the potential value proposition of an existing product is a challenging prospect. It requires a broad understanding of the market and identifying what makes the product stand out among the competition. It also requires identifying the potential benefits that a product can offer, and connecting it to the customer's problem.</p>

              <h6 style="text-align:left;">Competitive Analysis</h6>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Competitive analysis alows one to compare data about products and find gaps in the market. I started my project with this technique in order to get a realistic picture of the competitive landscape and find potential areas where the Cuckoo rice cooker can outdo the competition. To do this, I identified four potential competitors in the rice cooker market and analyzed various features across these products. I included the following products in my analysis: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuckoo-CRP-DH06-Crp-DHSR0609FD-Electric-Pressure/dp/B0721ZMW8K/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&keywords=cuckoo&qid=1614312047&s=home-garden&sr=1-12" target="_blank">Cuckoo Induction Heating Pressure Rice Cooker</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NP-NWC10XB-Pressure-Induction-Stainless/dp/B088FZXZHY/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=Pressure+Induction+Heating+Rice+Cooker+%26+Warmer+NP-NWC10%2F18&qid=1614385606&s=home-garden&sr=1-5" target="_blank">Zojirushi Pressure Induction Heating Rice Cooker</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHEF-Worlds-Smartest-Pressure-Cooker/dp/B0863JB424/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=chef+iq&qid=1614312018&s=home-garden&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQjJGOFo1UVdRRFBSJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzE4NTY4MkdWT1BVR1Q4UUdUJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0OTc0NTgzOVUyU1VUSFpGWFQ0JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==" target="_blank">CHEF iQ Smart Pressure Cooker</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Smart-Electric-Pressure/dp/B0777XQ4S8/ref=pd_di_sccai_3?pd_rd_w=VQmtV&pf_rd_p=c9443270-b914-4430-a90b-72e3e7e784e0&pf_rd_r=WWW8C04HX43NHW8SSBA4&pd_rd_r=ecdf2b48-6066-4d53-9bfb-1e68b8d01993&pd_rd_wg=VFiOE&pd_rd_i=B0777XQ4S8&psc=1" target="_blank">Instant Pot WiFi 8-in-1 Pressure Cooker</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aroma-Housewares-ARC-914SBD-Cool-Touch-Stainless/dp/B08B3BXJ57/ref=sxin_10?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.c805c120-2c6f-4847-a539-e1ec41e42d7b.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B007WQ9YNO&cv_ct_cx=rice%2Bcooker&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.c805c120-2c6f-4847-a539-e1ec41e42d7b.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&dchild=1&keywords=rice%2Bcooker&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B007WQ9YNO&pd_rd_r=7735cfe9-1fbf-4bb6-ac9e-680a1f5df6b6&pd_rd_w=Pw9Fs&pd_rd_wg=OLgJF&pf_rd_p=35b32c02-1b41-4e49-9b89-0297af2446e1&pf_rd_r=9AGPD3VRSF9NRV140FFN&qid=1614311873&s=home-garden&sr=1-1-64f3a41a-73ca-403a-923c-8152c45485fe&tag=scrippsonsite-20&th=1" target="_blank">Aroma Digital Rice Grain Cooker</a>.</p>

              <h6 style="text-align:left;">SWOT Matrix</h6>
              <p style="text-align:left;">SWOT analysis or matrix is a framework for assessing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that impact the user experience of a product. Based on the competitive analysis above, I was able to realistically determine the value proposition of the Cuckoo rice cooker.</p><br>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/cuckoo/swot.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" width="100%" alt="">
              <br><br><br>

              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Deep Dive into Owner's Pain Points</h5>
              <p style="text-align:left;">To better understand user’s challenges and pain points, I conducted a deep dive interview with five working professionals (three women and two men) in their 30s who currently own a Cuckoo Rice Cooker and use it at least more than three times a week. I drew from the weaknesses and key opportunities in the SWOT matrix to prepare the semi-structured interview guide and questions. Using this guide, I was able to get to the bottom of important problems that these users faced.</p>
              <p style="text-align:left;">Below are sample interview questions that I used in this guide:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which feature do you use the most on the Cuckoo rice cooker?</li>
                <li>If there are features that you don’t use as often, what are the reasons?</li>
                <li>How early do you plan ahead before cooking and how early do you start the rice cooker?</li>
                <li>Where do you find information about recipes that work with the Cuckoo rice cooker? What has helped you so far?</li>
                <li>If you had a magic wand, what would you change about the Cuckoo rice cooker?</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h6 style="text-align:left;">Identifying User Needs</h6>
              <p style="text-align:left;">The interviews pointed to many interesting findings and opportunities that can be translated into design insights. I gathered and synthesized data from the interview and clustered the notes via an affinity diagramming activity. I summarized the main findings below.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All users used fewer than three presets on a regular basis, including soft glutinous rice, mixed rice, and porridge. They complained of the lack of detailed information on when and how to use the other options, which tended to be more complex and cumbersome to use. This was partly due to the fact that the provided manual was inaccessible and unreadable in its current state.</li>
                <li>Despite the number of available options for cooking meat, bread and other non-grain food, three people deliberately chose not to cook meals (e.g., stew) other than grains out of fear that it might stain the cooker or leave a bad scent.</li>
                <li>All users had experience using the "reserve" option to set a time in advance at which the rice cooker can start cooking. They however complained that reserving and canceling can only be done by manually pressing a button on the device itself. Some people wished for the ability to reserve a time or start the cooker from a remote location using mobile app.</li>
                <li>Three out of five reported that they often forget to perform maintenance activities such as running a self-cleaning cycle or draining water collected on the backside of the rice cooker after using it. Failing to do so caused the rice to smell bad after cooking.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h6 style="text-align:left;">Persona</h6>
              <p style="text-align:left;">The clustering analysis served as guidance to construct a user persona for the cuckoo rice cooker, which is a fictional representation of a potential type of user that drives the product design. A typical persona includes a short profile description of the user, their goals, key characteristic attributes, and demographic characteristics such as internet usage.</p><br>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/cuckoo/cuckoo_persona.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" width="100%" alt=""><br>
              <br>
              <h6 style="text-align:left;">Visualizing User Needs</h6>
              <p style="text-align:left;">In order to better empathize with the user's concerns, based on the user persona, I reorganized key insights from the interview and structured them in ways that reflect their values. Through the empathy map, I was able to visually see what the users said, thought, did and felt.</p>
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/cuckoo/empathy_map.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" width="100%" alt="">
              <br><br>
              <br>
              <h5 style="text-align:left;">Prototype</h5>
              <p style="text-align:left;">I sketched a rough layout of a mobile app, or a paper prototype, to test the app’s navigation and workflow with potential users. Through paper prototyping, I wanted to quickly test ideas that I derived from my research.</p>
